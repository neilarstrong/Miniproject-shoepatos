                <h1 class="display-2">Beyond Jordan</h1><br> 
                <p>For its first 13 years of existence Nike’s Air Jordan Brand was completely reliant on its namesake to keep it alive and flourishing. Michael Jordan’s magnificent basketball career established the line of shoes and clothing as a sales juggernaut. The designs of the shoes were always top shelf—but would anyone care about those designs if “His Airness” didn’t dominate the NBA in them? Nike and Jordan Brand understood, and probably feared, the idea that one day MJ would have to retire permanently from the game of basketball. Despite Michael returning twice from retirement, he did eventually step away from the game for good. What would become of Jordan Brand? Would it also retire with the man who represented it so amazingly well? Could the shoes and line of athletic clothing survive without Michael Jordan being an active member of the NBA?

                    Nike was of course responsible for giving birth to the Air Jordan series, but from the start Nike tried to let its creation have its own identity. The Air Jordan II, for example, was revolutionary at the time for not including the famous Nike Swoosh anywhere on the sneaker. While that design independence made the Air Jordan line stand out, it also made it difficult to market without the help of its rock star endorser.</p>

                <h1 class="display-2">The Birth Of Jordan Brand</h1><br>
                <p>In 1997, Jordan Brand and Nike decided to let the Air Jordan line operate 100% independently. It was a bold decision that showed the strong belief Nike had in the brand. The decision was probably heavily influenced by the fact that at the time it was widely believed that the ‘97-98 basketball season would be Michael Jordan’s last. Nike had to do something gigantic to let it be known to the consumer that the Jumpman logo wasn’t going away and that it was here to stay.</p>
                <p>Jordan Brand was more than accepting and understanding of the fact that it was built on the back of the most beloved athlete in history. To survive separately from Nike, they would need talent from the sports world to endorse their company’s products.</p>
                <p>The first group of athletes to join Jordan Brand included basketball stars Vin Baker, Eddie Jones, Derek Anderson, Michael Finley and Ray Allen. At the time all of those players were young stars with bright futures ahead of them in the NBA. They all had a strong competitive nature and skills sets that were electrifying to watch. The youthful group also personified elegance—on and off the court. That collection of players, known as the “Class of 1997,” were the embodiment of what the Air Jordan name stood for.</p>

                <img id="myimg" src="images/allen.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="col-6"><br>
                <h1 class="display-2">Ray Allen</h1><br>
                <p>Ray Allen may be the brand’s biggest asset not named Michael Jordan. The guard made multiple championship runs and won a few rings while representing Jordan Brand. Ray always carried himself with class and had a lot of swagger present in his game. He is one of the best shooters that ever lived and achieved that by being extremely dedicated to his craft. He was known to wear “player exclusive” versions of adored Air Jordan sneakers that were designed specifically for him. Ray Allen brought a lot of dignity and positive attention to the company and its products.</p>
                <p>With their basketball roster locked in—Jordan Brand now looked to branch out into other sports. Yes, Air Jordan sneakers were known exclusively as basketball shoes during their early existence with Nike. However, to survive as a brand they had to offer more to the consumer than just kicks they could hoop in.</p>
                <p>The Jumpman logo represents a lot more than just a silhouette of Michael Jordan dunking. That logo stands for excellence—whether it’s viewed as a representation of Michael himself or his cherished clothing line. Few symbols in marketing history are more recognizable and beloved than The Jumpman. The basketball player Michael Jordan is long gone—but Jordan Brand is still going strong with no end in sight.</p>
